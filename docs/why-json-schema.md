# Why JSON Schema draft-2020-12?

RagaJSON uses JSON Schema draft-2020-12 as the format for defining raga structures and metadata.

This choice reflects our goals:

- Clear and strict validation of complex, structured musical data
- Modular and reusable schema components via `$ref`
- Support for conditional logic (`if/then`) to distinguish between Hindustani and Carnatic systems
- Controlled extensibility through `x-*` fields
- Compatibility with modern tools and editors

The 2020-12 version of JSON Schema gives us a robust foundation for building a maintainable and future-proof specification.
